# CLASSROOM TEAMS #

# Describe the plugin.

Classroom Teams greatly facilitates the creation of groups of students in classroom environments, despite it can be used in any other situation, both homogeneous and heterogeneous, and considering characteristics that each creator, usually a teacher or academic coordinator, can customize. It is useful to ensure that the groups are balanced, in accordance with the objective of the task and up to date. It also improves the relationship between the people in the "Team" and the collective in general, increasing confidence in the environment and promoting class cohesion.​

Its complete integration as a Moodle plug-in allows the use of student data stored in Moodle as particular characteristics of each student for the creation of groups. In addition, the groups created can be directly replicated in a Moodle course, allowing the teacher to benefit from all the collaborative options that the platform offers for their work groups.


# More details.

The Classroom Teams tool could create and manage teaching groups, which can be used to facilitate group work, discussion and collaboration among students. Currently there are some group related tools, which allows you to make random groupings by dividing a class into groups or number of people per group.​

​Eurecat Academy’s automatic group creation tool offers some unique features: ​

* Creation of teams by several features, including size of the teams, type of student, grades or course completion, etc. ​

* Creation of homogeneous teams (groups containing people with the same characteristics) or heterogeneous (groups with different characteristics).​

* Creation of new random groups considering past groupings ​

* Creation of groups considering incompatibilities among members​

The tool offers the teacher the possibility to display the created group on a full screen to be used in classroom activities. The created groups could be saved ad Moodle group to be used for further collaboration of the teams.​

The tool allows the  grouping students together based on various factors, such as their learning abilities, interests, or specific learning goals, to facilitate effective teaching and learning strategies, promote collaboration among students, and cater to individual needs.​

​​

Classroom groups can take different forms, depending on the educational objectives and the teaching approach employed by the instructor. Some common types of classroom groups include:​
​
1. Ability-based groups: Students are grouped based on their academic abilities or skill levels. This allows teachers to differentiate instruction and provide appropriate materials and activities for students at different proficiency levels.​

2. Heterogeneous groups: Students with diverse abilities, backgrounds, and learning styles are mixed together in groups. This approach encourages cooperation, peer learning, and social interaction among students with varied strengths and weaknesses.​

3. Homogeneous groups: Students with similar abilities or characteristics are grouped together. This grouping can be beneficial for targeting specific instructional needs or addressing common challenges faced by a particular group of students.​

4. Cooperative learning groups: Students are organized into small groups to work collaboratively on academic tasks or projects. This approach fosters teamwork, communication skills, and shared responsibility among students.​

5. Interest-based groups: Students are grouped based on their individual interests or passions. This approach aims to enhance engagement and motivation by allowing students to explore topics that align with their personal interests.​

​The purpose of classroom groups is to create an inclusive and supportive learning environment that maximizes student learning outcomes. By tailoring instruction and promoting collaboration within these groups, educators can address the diverse needs of students and facilitate their overall academic and social development.
